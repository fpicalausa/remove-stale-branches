# Remove Stale Branches

This Github Action will identify stale branches and mark them for deletion after a set period.

By default, branches are identified as stale if their latest commit is older than 90 days.
This is useful for repositories that have many contributors that work on and off, and may forget to cleanup üßπ

# How it works?

This Action look for branches whose last commit is older than a `days-before-branch-stale` days. It will first add a comment on the latest commit, notifying the contributor that their branch is stale. If no action is taken before `days-before-branch-delete` days, the branch will be removed.

This can be prevented by removing the comment, or adding new commits to the branch.

## ‚ö†Ô∏èüí£ CAUTION

Without setting `dry_run: true`, this action will remove branches. Consider setting `dry_run: true` until you are happy with how this action works.

You can also restrict this action to a subset of your branches using the `restrict-branches-regex` regular expression.

## Example usage

The follow examples show how you can use this action.

### Default configuration

This configuration will mark all branches (except for main/master) as stale after 90 days. After 7 more days, it will remove the branch.

```yml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *" # Everday at midnight

jobs:
  remove-stale-branches:
    name: Remove Stale Branches
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: fpicalausa/remove-stale-branches@v1.6.0
        with:
          dry-run: true # Check out the console output before setting this to false
```

### Cleanup branches from people who left an organization

This configuration will remove branches of people who are not longer part of the acme-inc organization after two weeks, except for [dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot).

```yml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *" # Everday at midnight

jobs:
  remove-stale-branches:
    name: Remove Stale Branches
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: fpicalausa/remove-stale-branches@v1.6.0
        with:
          dry-run: true # Check out the console output before setting this to false
          exempt-organization: "acme-inc"
          exempt-authors-regex: "^dependabot"
          days-before-branch-stale: 7
          days-before-branch-delete: 7
```

# Required scopes

The required scopes for the github token are:

```
contents: write
actions: read
pull-requests: read
```

Content write access is needed to read branches and commits, and also comment on those branches when they are stale.

Pull request read access is needed to understand if a branch is still attached to an open pull request.

# Why not using (your favorite action) instead?

There are many other actions to remove stale branches out there. Some just [remove branches](https://github.com/beatlabs/delete-old-branches-action), no question asked. Others close the branches out [through a PR](https://github.com/etiennemartin/stale-branch-action).

This action notifies users through a commit comment. There are pros and cons to each approach, pick the one that suits you best!

# Development & Build

To start, install dependencies with `npm install`. The source files live under `src`.

You can run the tool locally by:
1. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in a .env file with a PAT with correct access
2. Edit `src/cli.ts` as needed to point to the correct repo
3. Run `src/cli.ts` under `ts-node` as follows:

    ```shell
    source .env && npx ts-node src/cli.ts
    ```

To deploy you changes, start a PR. Don't forget to run `npm run build` and include changes to the `dist` dir in your commit.
